🌍 AQI Analysis Dashboard (Excel)
📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Air Quality Index (AQI) data across multiple countries to understand trends, identify pollution levels, and classify air quality status.
The dashboard was created entirely in Microsoft Excel using Power Query, Pivot Tables, and Charts.

🎯 Objectives

Analyzed the average and maximum AQI values.

Identified Top 10 countries with the highest AQI levels.

Visualized monthly, quarterly, and daily AQI trends.

Classified air quality into Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, and Hazardous statuses.

Enable dynamic data exploration using slicers and filters.

📅 Time Period Covered

Data analyzed for the years 2022 – 2025, covering multiple months and days to capture detailed seasonal and yearly trends.

🔍 Insights Gained

Countries like Bangladesh and India show consistently high AQI levels.

Air quality tends to worsen during winter months (Q4).

Weekdays show slightly higher AQI levels due to urban traffic activity.

Most days fall under the Moderate to Unhealthy categories.
